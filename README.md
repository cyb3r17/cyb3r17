Hello, I'm [cyber](https://cyb3r17.space)

I post code and projects mostly around **AI**, **robotics**, **rocketry/satellites**, **Bitcoin**, **cryptography**, and other scripts.  
You'll also find my **electrical engineering** work here – **PCBs**, circuit designs, and more.

I'm currently learning **Computer Vision**, **Reinforcement Learning**, **PCB Design** and **Rust**.

I'm currently working on [Shunya Research](https://shunyaresearch.systems), a student led AI research lab that focuses on transformer alternate architectures and affordable non-intrusive
neural interfaces. Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/shunyaresearch) for updates.
